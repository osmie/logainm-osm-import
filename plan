==Goals==

Logainm, which is the Irish for "place name", is the website of the Bunachar Logainmneacha na hÉireann (Placenames Database of Ireland). They recently released their data under ODbL, and the goal is to import as much as possible.

We want to add the offical irish name (name:ga), offical english name (name:en), and the logainm reference code to Irish administrative boundaries (townlands (admin_level=10), EDs (admin_level=9), Counties (admin_level=6 and 7), subtownlands (place=locality, locality=subtownland), civil parishes (boundary=civil_parish) and baronies (boundary=barony)).

This will radically improve the coverage of Irish names for administrative boundaries in OSM. It will also allow 2 databases (OSM & Logainm) to be cross-referenced.

==Community support==

I, (Rorym), plan to do the import, and am an active member of the Irish OpenStreetMap community, I'm an active mapper of townlands, and have made a website, townlands.ie, which shows the current townland coverage and has various QA tools for townland mapping. The rest of the Irish OSM community is in favour of this. [https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-ie/2014-October/000715.html talk-ie thread with much approval]

== Schedule==

As soon as approval has been given, and at regular intervals after that.

The Irish OSM community is currently mapping townlands (etc.), and is about 80% done. We expect to be done in a year. Hence this will be a semi-continuous import process, which will be occassionally run to update the OSM data that has been added since the last run. Additional runs should be considered part of this import.

==Import Data==

===Background===

'''Data source site:''' Bunachar Logainmneacha na hÉireann (Placenames Database of Ireland) [http://www.logainm.ie/ Logainm.ie]. I have [http://www.logainm.ie/en/inf/proj-machines followed their instructions] and have [http://www.technomancy.org/logainm/ downloaded the full data].
'''Data license:''' ODbL v1.0 ( http://www.logainm.ie/en/inf/proj-xml )
'''OSM attribution (if required):''' N/A
'''ODbL Compliance verified:''' yes

===OSM Data Files===

===Import Type===

The Irish OSM community is currently mapping townlands (etc.), and is about 80% done. We expect to be done in a year. Hence this will be a semi-continuous import process, which will be occassionally run to update the OSM data that has been added since the last run. New uploads will be manually run.

JOSM upload will be used.

==Data Preparation==

===Data Reduction & Simplification===

There is no need to simplify or reduce the data.

===Tagging Plans===

{|
!OSM Tag
!Source
!Justification
|-
|logainm:ref
|Logainm numeric ID
|Allows one to cross reference OSM data with Logainm at a later date
|-
|name:ga
|Logainm Irish name
|If the object in OSM doesn't have an Irish name, we'll use the one from Logainm
|-
|name:en
|Logainm English name
|If there is no name:en for an object, we'll use the logianm one
|-
|offical_name:en
|Logainm English Name
|If the name (or name:en) is different from logain, we'll use this as the "offical name"
|-
|offical_name:ga
|Logainm Irish Name
|If the name:ga already in OSM is different from logainm, we'll use this as the offical name
|}

===Changeset Tags===

We will add these changeset tags

{|
|source
|logainm.ie
|-
|comment
|Import of Logainm data
|}

===Data Transformation===

[https://github.com/rory/logainm-osm-import Code will be hosted here]

===Data Transformation Results===

Not created yet.

==Data Merge Workflow==

===Team Approach===

Most coding and uploading will be done by rorym, but advice will be sought from the OSM-IE community.

===References===

List all factors that will be evaluated in the import.

===Workflow===

* Download current OSM data for the objects to be updated
* Match up logainm details and edit XML file
* Open in JOSM and upload

===Conflation===

Since this import will only add tags to existing OSM objects (rather than add new OSM objects), there is no chance of duplication.

When looking at the OSM objects, which already has a (say) a name:ga tag, the software will defer to the exisiting OSM data.

==QA==

OSM-IE has created [www.townlands.ie Townlands.ie], which is used to help track mapping of townlands, and for QA of the mapped data. We can add features to this.
